		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>This application was written out of frustration with the EIA's data sources.  Our company possess multiple applications that need to access fuel data on a regular basis yet the only method provided for access is an RSS feed which has to be scraped and parsed.  To right this wrong, this application provdies multiple means of accessing the data: a web friendly api, email updates and a web interface.  Developers or anyone can freely choose how they want to consume the data.</p>
